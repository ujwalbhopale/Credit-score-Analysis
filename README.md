Credit Risk Scoring System

Project Overview:
This project implements a full end-to-end Credit Risk Scoring System aligned exactly with the implemented notebook/code. 
It covers data ingestion from multiple sources, synthetic transaction enrichment, rigorous EDA, feature engineering, 
statistical feature selection (VIF, WOE/IV), multiple model families, imbalance handling, hyper-parameter optimization (RandomizedSearch & Optuna), and 
business-grade evaluation (ROC-AUC, KS, Gini), followed by Power BI consumption.

Business Objective
Predict probability of loan default at customer–loan level
Reduce credit losses while maintaining approval quality
Build a regulator-friendly, explainable scorecard-style solution
Produce outputs ready for Power BI dashboards

This project focuses on analyzing customer, loan, and credit behavior data to identify 
factors that contribute to loan default risk. The goal is to help financial institutions 
make data-driven, transparent, and explainable credit decisions.

The project involves: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Feature engineering 
Categorical encoding Correlation analysis Business-oriented insights aligned with problem expectations

Objectives Identify risky loan applicants early Understand how customer demographics, credit behavior, 
and loan characteristics impact defaults Provide explainable insights for credit
approval decisions Prepare a machine-learning-ready dataset
